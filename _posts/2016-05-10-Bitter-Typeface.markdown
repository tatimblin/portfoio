        <p>
            In creating this site I began with building off of a single template I created of a base for the other pages. In doing this I
    was able to have all the page’s similarities up and running quickly as well as have everything ‘global’ run off of a
    single css file, for easy manipulation of those elements. Features then local to a specific page where implemented in
    their copy of the HTML and styled in a separate css file, this is a well-practiced method for web development, but was
    my first time implementing such practice to its full effect.
